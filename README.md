## General Requirements
- [ ] smart lock
- [ ] smart fridge
- [ ] smart light
- [ ] smart speaker
- [ ] iphone app

## Methods
### Smart Fridge
The smart fridge will be the best display of translating physical objects into a mediuim of which can be handled by a smart home infrastructure. The device will be able to:
* Take pictures of "what's inside" the fridge
* Track dates of stuff in the fridge
* Appropriately cache, store, and serve image files of fridge contents

### Smart Lock
The smart lock will be the best demonstration of the ability of the smart home infrastructure to directly influence home security methods. While building an alarm system would be entertaining to build, and provide a practical application for the smart home infrastructure by showing the proof-of-concept for a modular addition to the ecosystem, it is outside of the time scope for this project.

### Smart Light
This will be the coolest piece, but also very rudimentary. At a fundamental level, it will turn an LED on and off remotely. At the best level, it will allow for a multi-colored LED to be controlled.

### Smart Speaker
This will be the most practical piece of the ecosystem, and will provide for a technology of which can have a "conversation" with the user. This will be the best test of secure web requests, and securing an IoT "gateway". This will involve external requests, and for the scope of this project, will be limited to Spotify requests, or something emulating that.

### iPhone App
This will be the bread and butter of the project - controlling things with the iPhone app. In the event that the smart speaker is ultimately not feasible, the iPhone app will be the driver of the ecosystem.

The project is intended to be compelted in this order:
1. Smart Light
2. Smart Fridge
3. Smart Lock
4. iPhone App
5. Smart Speaker
